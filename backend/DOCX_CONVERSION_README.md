# Improved DOCX to PDF Conversion

## Problem
The original `docx2pdf` library was losing all formatting and styles when converting DOCX files to PDF. This resulted in plain text PDFs without any of the original document styling.

## Solution
We've implemented a multi-method approach that tries different conversion methods in order of preference to preserve formatting:

### Method 1: LibreOffice (Recommended)
- **Best for**: Preserving all styles, formatting, and layout
- **Requirements**: LibreOffice installed on the system
- **Command**: `soffice --headless --convert-to pdf --outdir <output_dir> <input_file>`
- **Pros**: Excellent style preservation, handles complex layouts
- **Cons**: Requires LibreOffice installation

### Method 2: Pandoc
- **Best for**: Preserving basic formatting and structure
- **Requirements**: Pandoc installed on the system
- **Pros**: Good text formatting preservation, handles tables and lists
- **Cons**: May lose some complex styling

### Method 3: docx2pdf (Fallback)
- **Best for**: Basic conversion when other methods fail
- **Requirements**: Windows + Microsoft Word
- **Pros**: Simple, no external dependencies
- **Cons**: Poor style preservation, Windows-only

### Method 4: Manual Conversion (python-docx + reportlab)
- **Best for**: Preserving basic text formatting when other methods fail
- **Requirements**: python-docx and reportlab libraries
- **Pros**: Preserves bold, italic, alignment, works cross-platform
- **Cons**: Limited to basic text formatting, no complex layouts

## Installation Requirements

### For LibreOffice (Best Results)
```bash
# Windows: Download from https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/
# macOS: brew install --cask libreoffice
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install libreoffice
```

### For Pandoc
```bash
# Windows: Download from https://pandoc.org/installing.html
# macOS: brew install pandoc
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install pandoc
```

### Python Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The conversion automatically tries all methods in order:

```python
from services.file_converter import FileConverter

converter = FileConverter()
pdf_path = await converter.convert_to_pdf(docx_file_path, '.docx')
```

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the improved conversion:

```bash
cd backend
python test_docx_conversion.py
```

This will:
1. Create a test DOCX with various styles (bold, italic, alignment)
2. Convert it to PDF using the improved methods
3. Verify the PDF was created successfully

## Troubleshooting

### LibreOffice Not Found
- Ensure LibreOffice is installed and in your system PATH
- On Windows, you may need to add the LibreOffice installation directory to PATH

### Pandoc Not Found
- Install pandoc from https://pandoc.org/installing.html
- Ensure it's available in your system PATH

### Style Preservation Issues
1. Try installing LibreOffice for best results
2. Check that the DOCX file actually contains the styles you expect
3. Use the test script to verify the conversion is working

## Performance Notes

- LibreOffice conversion is slower but produces the best results
- Pandoc is faster and good for most use cases
- Manual conversion is fastest but limited in style preservation
- The system automatically falls back to the next method if one fails

## Future Improvements

- Add support for more complex styles (tables, images, headers/footers)
- Implement caching for converted documents
- Add progress callbacks for long conversions
- Support for batch conversion of multiple files
